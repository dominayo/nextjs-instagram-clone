  Instagram Clone made with NextJs + TailwindCss
</h1>

<h3>I made this project for learning NextJs. </h3>
<h3>Demo: https://nextjs-instagram-clone.vercel.app/</h3>

<h4>What did I use?</h5>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.Js</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.tailwindcss.com">TailwindCss</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://recoiljs.org/">Recoil Js</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is a mobile responsive instagram clone example but only homepage. I set up links for other pages but designing them is meaningless. The data is static, not fetching from any api. You can edit the content data from /static/example_data.js and logged user data is in atom's default value, you can edit them from /atoms/globalState.js
  <br><br>
  I used <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel.com</a> for building project.
  <br><br>
  Best thing of building with vercel like websites is that when you change anything, I mean push a new commit, it will be re-builded again and published. 
  <br><br>
  <b>Note:</b> Somehow, photo slide is not working well as it is in localhost. You need to go next photo and come back to fix it. I will not work on cause of the problem as this is already an example project and already spent 2 days on this. But I am open for pull requests ^^
